    ; Valid syntaxes are:

    ; Choose how the process manager will control the number of child processes.
    ; Possible Values:
    ;   static  - a fixed number (pm.max_children) of child processes;
    ;   dynamic - the number of child processes are set dynamically based on the
    ;             following directives. With this process management, there will be
    ;             always at least 1 children.
    ;             pm.max_children      - the maximum number of children that can
    ;                                    be alive at the same time.
    ;             pm.start_servers     - the number of children created on startup.
    ;             pm.min_spare_servers - the minimum number of children in 'idle'
    ;                                    state (waiting to process). If the number
    ;                                    of 'idle' processes is less than this
    ;                                    number then some children will be created.
    ;             pm.max_spare_servers - the maximum number of children in 'idle'
    ;                                    state (waiting to process). If the number
    ;                                    of 'idle' processes is greater than this
    ;                                    number then some children will be killed.
    ;  ondemand - no children are created at startup. Children will be forked when
    ;             new requests will connect. The following parameter are used:
    ;             pm.max_children           - the maximum number of children that
    ;                                         can be alive at the same time.
    ;             pm.process_idle_timeout   - The number of seconds after which
    ;                                         an idle process will be killed.
    ; Note: This value is mandatory.
